## Study experience
- Two CW memorization exams. The final exam, which involved manually calculating neural networks, was extremely tedious; it was easy to make mistakes, and it could take 40-60 minutes. The main content of the lectures was neural networks from 1940 to 1980. The later the lectures went, the more disorganized the PowerPoint presentations became. I only recommend rote memorization; it's very outdated.
